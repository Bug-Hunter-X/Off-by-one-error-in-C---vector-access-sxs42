This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when accessing elements in a C++ `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an element beyond the vector's bounds. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version of the code. This type of error can lead to program crashes or unexpected behavior, so careful attention to loop boundaries is essential when working with vectors and other array-like data structures.
